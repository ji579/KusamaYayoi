      "This catalog accompanies the Fondation Beyeler's major autumn 2025 exhibition dedicated to the celebrated Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama (born 1929). As the first retrospective of Kusama's work in Switzerland, this landmark publication offers a comprehensive exploration of her more than seven-decade career. Developed in close collaboration with the artist and her studio, the catalog presents an in-depth look at Kusama's diverse body of work, from her early creations―some never before seen in Europe―to her most iconic pieces, as well as new productions and one of her renowned Infinity Mirror rooms. Richly illustrated, the catalog examines Kusama's signature artistic language, characterized by obsessive repetition and boundless mirrored spaces that transport viewers into infinite realms. It serves as an essential reference for anyone seeking to understand Kusama's enduring impact on contemporary art.\n" +
      "Yayoi Kusama (born 1929) has worked not only in sculpture and installation but also painting, performance, video art, fashion, poetry, fiction and other arts. With her late-1950s move to New York City, she joined the ranks of the avant-garde, working in soft sculpture and influencing the likes of Warhol and Oldenburg. At this time, she was also involved with happenings and other performance-oriented works and began to deploy her signature dots. Her work fell into relative obscurity after her return to Japan in 1973, but a subsequent revival of interest in the 1980s elevated her work to the canonical status it still enjoys today.",

      "An examination of Yayoi Kusama's work that goes beyond the usual biographical interpretation to consider her place in postwar global art history.\n" +
      "Yayoi Kusama is the most famous artist to emerge from Japan in the period following World War II. Part of a burgeoning international art scene in the early 1960s, she exhibited in New York with Andy Warhol, Donald Judd, Claes Oldenburg, and other Pop and Minimalist luminaries, and in Europe with the Dutch Nul and the German Zero artist groups. Known for repetitive patterns, sewn soft sculptures, naked performance, and suggestive content, Kusama's work anticipated the politically charged feminist art of the 1970s. But Kusama and her work were soon eclipsed by a dealer-controlled art market monopoly of white male American artists. Returning to Japan in 1973, Kusama became almost as famous for her self-proclaimed mental illness and permanent residence in a psychiatric hospital as she was for her art. In this book, Midori Yamamura eschews the usual critical fascination with Kusama's biography to consider the artist in her social and cultural milieu. By examining Kusama's art alongside that of her peers, Yamamura offers a new perspective on Kusama's career.\n" +
      'Yamamura shows that Kusama, who came of age in totalitarian wartime Japan, embraced art as an anticonformist pursuit, seeking a subjective autonomy that resulted in the singular expression of her art. Examining Kusama\'s association with European and New York art movements of the 1960s and her creation of psychedelic light-and-sound "Happenings," Yamamura argues that Kusama and her heterogeneous peers defied and undermined various pillars of modernity during the crucial transition from the modern nation-state to global free-market capitalism.\n' +
      "The art market rediscovered Kusama in the 1990s, and she has since had a series of high-profile exhibitions. Recounting Kusama's story, Yamamura offers an incisive, penetrating analysis of postwar art's globalization as viewed from the periphery.",

      "Yayoi Kusama: Give Me Love documents the artist’s most recent exhibition at David Zwirner, New York, which marked the US debut of The Obliteration Room, an all-white, domestic interior that viewers are invited to cover with dot stickers of various sizes and colors.\n" +
      "Widely recognized as one of the most popular artists in the world, Yayoi Kusama has shaped her own narrative of postwar and contemporary art. Minimalism and Pop art, abstraction and conceptualism coincide in her practice, which spans painting, sculpture, performance, room-sized and outdoor installation, the written word, films, fashion, design, and architectural interventions. Born in 1929 in Matsumoto, Japan, Yayoi Kusama briefly studied painting in Kyoto before moving to New York City in the late 1950s. In the mid-1960s, she established herself in New York as an important avant-garde artist by staging groundbreaking happenings, events, and exhibitions. Now in her late 80s, Kusama is entering one of the richest creative periods of her life. Immersed in her studio six days a week, Kusama has spoken of her renewed dedication to creating art over the past years: [N]ew ideas come welling up every day….Now I am more keenly aware of the time that remains and more in awe of the vast scope of art.\n" +
      "Taking The Obliteration Room as its centerpiece, this catalogue reveals, in vivid large-scale plates, the transformation of the space from a clean white interior to a stunningly saturated room, with ceilings, walls, and furniture covered in myriad multicolored stickers put there by viewers over the course of the exhibition. The catalogue also includes beautiful reproductions of Kusama’s new large-format paintings from My Eternal Soul series. Ranging from bright and densely pixelated forms, to umber figures with darker blues and muted oranges, these paintings demonstrate the artist’s striking command of color, and her exceptional control over balance and contrast. Bold brushstrokes hover between figuration and abstraction; vibrant, animated, and intense, these paintings introduce their own powerful pictorial logic, at once contemporary and universal. The catalogue continues with a selection of new, large Pumpkin sculptures, a form that Kusama has been exploring since her studies in Japan in the 1950s, and which gained prominence in the 1980s, continuing to remain an essential part of her practice. Made of shiny stainless steel and featuring painted dots or dot-shaped perforations that recall The Obliteration Room, these immersive works seem created on human scale, with the tallest measuring 70 inches (178 cm). Vibrant plates capture how color, shape, size, and surface merge in these sculptures and mesmerize the viewer. Texts include a Hymn to Yayoi Kusama by art critic and poet Akira Tatehata and a poem by the artist herself.",

      "Like many another artist émigré, Kusama had a plan, and it began, as such schemes often do, with what she was able to carry on her back, and sell: a cache of small works on paper, luminous drawings in gouache, ink and pastel. A film of Kusama's New York years might find her peeling the sheets leaf by leaf from the luggage that accompanied her from Tokyo to Seattle to New York, offering them as calling cards and as barter. Early scenes might feature marathon sessions of solitary work as she painted her vast Infinity Nets, and nocturnal raids when she liberated discarded items from the street, and sat for hours with her neighbor Donald Judd stitching and stuffing cotton sacks to fashion the stiff phallic protuberances she would use to cover her Accumulation sculptures. Her prodigious energies would soon migrate to installations, happenings, body painting, film, fashion and 'sexual revolution'. She would protest the war in Vietnam with an 'Anatomic Explosion' on Wall Street. She would become a tabloid sensation.\n" +
      "By the time she left New York and returned to Japan for good in 1973, Kusama was, by popular account, 'as famous as Andy Warhol'. But her appeal for the avant-garde had been exhausted, unlike his, by the machinery of self-promotion. Or so they say. Chroniclers of the scene deemed her return a retreat, whether under the banner of emotional breakdown or career meltdown. 'She wore herself out.' 'She overplayed her hand.' 'She sold out.' 'She lost her mind.' The explanations tend to arrive in the form of epithets. And then there is another theory. She was sick and tired of war, burnt out on Vietnam, disillusioned by the failure of the era's utopian project of pacifism and liberation. Her departure was an act of political protest as much as of emotional surrender.",

      "Kusama Yayoi is a Japanese contemporary artist known for her repetitive dot patterns and hallucinatory imagery. She works across a variety of media, including painting, sculpture, installation, and performance, exploring themes of self-effacement and obsessive repetition. These themes are intertwined with her long-standing psychological struggles, which she reflects in her work.\n" +
      "After moving to New York in the late 1950s and establishing her career, she established a distinctive style that garnered international recognition. Kusama continues to work prolifically today, creating powerful visual experiences through iconic works like polka dots and infinity mirrored rooms.",
