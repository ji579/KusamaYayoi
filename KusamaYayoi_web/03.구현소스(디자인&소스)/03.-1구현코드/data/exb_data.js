    exbtxt: `From a young age, Kusama has suffered from visual and auditory hallucinations. Her mental health condition has had a tremendous impact on the artist’s creative activities. In the 1950s, driven by her own obsessions, Kusama created an enormous number of drawings, resulting in an opportunity to make her breakthrough as an artist. After relocating to the United States in 1957, the artist began to create a series of works that could be described as ritual of “self-obliteration,” where all existence is engulfed in infinitely repetitive patterns such as polka dots and nets while the self is immersed into a boundless world. These works express a desire for salvation from psychological disorders and simultaneously reflect her intention to liberate society from absurd oppression through happenings and other forms of expression. However, from the late 1970s to the 1980s, after returning to Japan due to mental and physical health conditions, Kusama created small-scale works such as collages and works on ‘shikishi’ paperboards in her room in a psychiatric hospital. Subsequently, her creations expanded to an environmental scale, such as multi-canvas paintings and gigantic inflatable works. Kusama’s concept of “self-obliteration” is no longer solely a matter of the artist’s inner psyche; rather, it invites us into this sensation as though we are caught in a solemn “reverberation from the universe.”

            This exhibition focuses on the theme of illness, which can be described as the driving force behind Kusama’s art, showcasing a diverse range of works and related materials from her early years to the present day. We invite you to witness these productions of Kusama’s abundant creativity that reverberate to the farthest reaches of the universe.

    exbtxt: `Yayoi Kusama has constantly faced the critical realities of life and death as pressing issues. Her experience of the Pacific War in a complex family environment, along with her overcoming of suicidal impulses triggered by trauma and neurosis through her creative practices, has influenced her perception of these issues. This exhibition unveils Kusama’s evolving outlook on life and death, alongside the corresponding shifts in her artistic presentation, through a series of diverse works—from her 1940s and 1950s paintings, which bear the imprint of war, to her very latest pieces.

            After relocating to the United States in 1957, Kusama gained a reputation for her net paintings and sculptures that embody ‘self-obliteration’: the feeling of losing the boundary between the self and the other through the obsessive repetition of motifs originating from her hallucinations. In her anti-war happenings in the late 1960s, she painted dots onto the human body using the same concept of ‘self-obliteration’ while also highlighting the beauty of life and the human body. During the 1970s and 80s, following the loss of her father and her lover, as well as her return to Japan due to health issues, Kusama produced numerous dark-toned collages and three-dimensional works centered on the theme of death, as well as poetry and novels imbued with a sense of mortality. As she continued creating fantastical works exploring death and the afterlife, her works from the late 1980s began to explore themes of transmigration and cyclical returns to eternity through ‘self-obliteration’. Kusama’s works, which increasingly incorporated more colors, reveal how her creative process evolved from a means of coping with death to becoming synonymous with her very existence. In her painting series from 2000 onwards, Kusama has been relentlessly depicting the beauty of life and the joy of living on canvases overflowing with vibrant colors, driven by the ever-looming presence of her own death.`,

    exbtxt: `The sketchbooks from Yayoi Kusama’s teenage years contain numerous studies of flora and fauna, accurately portrayed with fine details. While Kusama is widely recognized for her abstract paintings characterized by the repetition of singular motifs, her early emphasis on observation and figurative depictions through sketches formed the foundation of her artistic journey, serving as a means of translating her visions and inner perceptions into figurative forms.

This exhibition focuses on the diverse trajectories of Kusama’s figurative works, spanning from the 1940s to the present day. Most artworks offer detailed and figurative portrayals of familiar motifs, such as animals, plants, and everyday objects. Works include early sketches and traditional Japanese paintings from before her move to the United States, collages that she worked on intensively from the 1970s to the 1990s, as well as prints she has been producing prolifically since 1979.

This exhibition also displays several series of paintings representative of Kusama’s more recent endeavors since 2000. Selected works that feature motifs such as self-portraits and mysterious figures painted freely across canvases of varying sizes are showcased. These works are characterized by figurative images, such as profiles or eyes, repeated to fill the entirety of the canvas, creating an appearance that closely resembles allover abstract art. Highlighting one of Kusama’s most favored themes, the pumpkin motif, we present an installation of the mirror room created in commemoration of the museum’s inauguration along with a separate large-scale sculpture. Moreover, the latest soft sculpture-covered boat, a concept first introduced by Kusama in the 1960s, is presented for its world premiere.`,

    exbtxt: `In recent years, Yayoi Kusama’s paintings have featured a diverse range of color contrasts, such as copper with light blue in lines that depict the entire universe, surprising viewers with their novel expressions. This exhibition showcases representative series from her early period to the present, tracing the evolution of Kusama’s distinctive color expressions throughout her artistic career.

In Kusama’s early representative work Lingering Dream created in 1949, viewers can observe dark yet surreal colors. However, after moving to the United States in 1957 and embarking on new artistic expressions, Kusama chose ascetic color schemes in pursuit of the effect of ‘self-obliteration.’ She created paintings with repeating patterns such as monochrome nets and three-dimensional works where entire surfaces were filled with a single color. In the collages and drawings of the small works produced in the 1970s upon her return to Japan, a rich and poetic use of colors emerged. Simultaneously, in her net paintings, she began to produce many variations in the contrast between the background color and drawn lines. This expression evolved into intense color representations, some inducing optical dizziness, throughout the 1980s and 1990s. This development was further amplified in her three-dimensional works and immersive installation pieces. In her recent works, while some are vibrant and optimistic paintings brimming with primary colors and hope, there are also pieces employing a lot of black, reflecting thoughts of suicide. These diverse color expressions appear to flicker and transform rapidly, as if contrasting the light and shadow of Kusama's inner world.`,

    exbtxt: `Yayoi Kusama calls the feeling of losing the boundary between the self and the other through the obsessive repetition and proliferation of a single motif, "self-obliteration," and expresses it through various mediums in her works. This practice, which stems from childhood hallucinations, has been Kusama's signature theme since the beginning of her artistic career. In her works, the principle of repetition, reflections of mirrors, use of flickering lights, and other means of representation can make the viewers fall into a trance-like state. Such expressions of her works are reminiscent of the perception of hallucinogenic effects that characterized the psychedelic movement sweeping America, where Kusama was based, in the latter half of the 1960s. In other words, Kusama’s works invoke similarities with the visual effects of hallucinogenic drugs, inducing viewers to experience the perceptual transformations.

This exhibition focuses on the psychedelic aspects of Kusama's work and presents rich variations of her creations from different periods. It includes the premiere of her latest series of hexagonal mirrored rooms – first presented at her solo exhibition in New York in the latter half of the 1960s, as well as a film and related materials that consist of video recordings of happenings and other events. Through these showcases, this exhibition introduces Kusama's activities at that time, which were also a driving force of the psychedelic movement. The exhibition also features drawings from Kusama's early years, in which she freely depicted her internal images, as well as those created after her return to Japan, such as acrylic paintings in vivid colors, large three-dimensional works, an installation using black light, short videos, and literary work. We hope you will enjoy the psychedelic viewing experience created by Kusama's vision of self-obliteration.`,

My Eternal Soul, a series of over 800 large-scale acrylic paintings between 2009 and 2021, has been downsized from 2018 onwards. This trend continues in the new series mainly consisting of smaller sized paintings. Alongside with this, we are pleased to show the recent creation of My Eternal Soul, small-scale marker drawings Kusama has been intermittently working on since 2000, and her latest works such as a small peep-in mirror room and installations that allow you to experience her visual perception. In addition, Kusama’s recent poetry, which expresses her devotion to art and her daily prayers for love and death, is presented.

    exbtxt: `The source of Yayoi Kusama’s creative drive comes from a place that is deeply personal, as such, they are embodiment of her childhood hallucinatory experiences and visions overflowing from her inner world. In the early 1950s, shortly after her debut as an artist, Kusama received high reputation from art experts such as art critic, Shuzo Takiguchi and painter, Nobuya Abe. Kusama's works, which are free from any constraint, already showed outstanding originality at that time. At the same time, her works which are “all about my [her] inner issues” reveal common features with Surrealism, which focus on infinitely expanding imagination free from rational thoughts and expressions, as well as internal imagery.
　In this exhibition, we introduce Kusama's diverse works reminiscent of Surrealism, which portray images overflowing from her inner world and struggles in her mind as they really are. The exhibition includes two-dimensional works from the beginning of her artistic career, which use various materials and techniques, such as Nihonga (Japanese-style painting), oil painting, watercolor, and pastel. Other featured works include three-dimensional works presenting a consistent manifestation of images exemplified through the accumulation of organic forms, and an installation piece based on her hallucinatory experiences. Her latest large-scale series of acrylic paintings, My Eternal Soul, depict visions that come to her mind as she moves her brush. Please enjoy Kusama's richly diverse creations derived from images in her mind that never cease to proliferate from her early days to the present.`,

―Yayoi Kusama, “Ivan the Fool,” 1955

Since ancient times, monochrome has been popular in both the East and the West as ink wash paintings and monochromatic paintings. In the twentieth century, monochrome has been developed in various art movements alongside the progress of abstract expression.
Yayoi Kusama has also produced a number of monochrome works. Starting with the monochrome paintings represented by Infinity Nets – a series that she has continued to produce since its release in 1959, to soft sculptures painted with white, gold, or silver. From mirrored rooms that reflect all kinds of colors despite being monochromatic themselves, to installations that fill spaces with monochromatic flowers, to her latest series of paintings, My Eternal Soul. Kusama continues to work with a palette limited to a single color, or to two colors including the ground color.
In these works, the image and the ground are fluid, covering the surface of the work in an all-over manner, and giving the impression of extending outward from the work itself. Here, monochrome emphasizes the repetition, or unifies the accumulation, and plays a major role in amplifying the intense visuality and sense of drive.
In this exhibition, we present a variety of Kusama's monochrome works from her early years to the present, and introduce her unique world of monochrome, which can be said to be an enantiosis exploration of color in the expression of self-obliteration that she has consistently pursued.`,

Later, it became a driving force in promoting collaboration and solidarity between European avant-garde artists, who were left isolated by World War Ⅱ. When she was based in New York in the 1960s, Kusama participated in group ZERO-related exhibitions many times, attracting attention within the European art scene. Yayoi Kusama, who pursues “Infinity”, has various similarities in her artistic expression with that of ZERO artists, such as the repetition of motifs and the pursuit of monochrome. This exhibition introduces the ZERO movement and its works, which have not been widely presented in Japan yet, together with Kusama’s works and documentation from the 1960s. It traces the journey of avant-garde artists who overcame the wounds of war, initiating the possibility of a brand-new art through exploring two opposite poles, Zero and Infinity.`,

This body of art began with two-dimensional collages, using everyday objects such as stickers, before extending into the medium of soft sculpture – domestic objects, including furniture, covered with proliferations of sewn, stuffed fabric phalli. Since then, Kusama has continued to create various types of Accumulation pieces, even now.

On this occasion, Yayoi Kusama Museum presents the very early pieces from the Accumulation series, as well as photographs and documents related to the series’ production. Through these works, the exhibition features how Kusama bridged the artistic boundaries between painting and sculpture in order to represent her compulsive obsession with the hallucinations she experienced as a young girl, as well as her neurotic anxieties over sex and her disgust towards industrially-made food stuff.

Dots Obsession, an installation exhibited frequently since the late 1990s and perceived as an accumulation of polka dots and a magnified soft sculpture, is displayed alongside selected works from Kusama’s latest large canvas series My Eternal Soul - presented as her current manifestations of Accumulation.

Alongside showcasing her latest canvas series My Eternal Soul and her recent Infinity Mirror Room, the exhibition introduces Yayoi Kusama's creative starting point, tracing the footprints of abundant ingenuity of an artist who continues to know no bounds, saying "Here, Now, I have Reached the Grandest Start of My Life".
